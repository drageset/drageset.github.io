    "summary":"I am currently studying Artificial Intelligence on masters level, and my bachelor is in Cognitive Science with a large specialization of computer science subjects. I enjoy team work, programming, and data modeling, which are some of the areas which I excel in. I find the process of coming up with, discussing, developing, and implementing ideas with a group of skilled colleagues with different backgrounds and outlooks very rewarding. I have experience teaching basic web development to undergraduate students, and enjoy working with semantic technologies and ontology building. As a hobby I like to build 2D games in Unity."
